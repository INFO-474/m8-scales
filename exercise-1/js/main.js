// Use d3.min and d3.max to determine the domain of your scale


// Define a linear scale with your data domain and an output range of 50, 500


// You'll have to wait for you page to load to assign events to the elements created in your index.html file
$(function() {
  // Select SVG with id `my-svg` and assign it a width of 600 and a height of 100

  // Define an axis for your scale with the ticks oriented on the bottom

  // Append a `g` element to your svg, shift it down 50 pixels by setting the transform property, and call your `axis function`

  // Append a circle for each element in your data by using the standard D3 data binding process

  // Enter new circles

  // Draw circles
